# Forecasting
In this project, I'm using  Facebook Prophet Library for predicting value in the future. Facebook Prophet is an open-source library for univariate (one variable) time series forecasting developed by Facebook.
Prophet implements what they refer to as an additive time series forecasting model, and the implementation supports trends, seasonality, and holidays.
